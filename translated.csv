I'm happy for CIG to keep XT running to fix the game long term.  However perhaps they need to stop adding content for a patch or two and fix major issues properly before adding antigen else.  This would improve the base experience and perhaps bring more players over all in to the game and give the same total amount of data. Just my 2c
who is Aim To Head? this music just needs the right club/environment to become very popular

Whoevers the artist. He/she has got some seriously crazy talent
"Strigoi is a Romanian word (and slavic). Word-by-word, it would be translated ""screaminger"", from the verb ""striga"" which means ""to scream"". You could say it can be translated as ""screamer"", but it is not really that close. Strigoi is a vampire-like creature or a skinwalker, some kind of ugly evil undead, nothing sexy about it, like the thumbnail suggests. And it does not exist, of course. :)"
Top best so father !!
"This is somekind upgrade from ""UNCARED"" . Howewer , thanks"
